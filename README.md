Analysis of YouTube Video Category Preferences

Project Overview :
This project presents an empirical statistical analysis of YouTube video category preferences based on primary survey data. The study investigates how demographic and behavioral factors influence users’ choices across different types of YouTube content.

Objectives :
1. To examine the association between user characteristics and preferred YouTube video categories

2. To compare proportions of preferences across different user groups

3. To identify and rank significant differences using pairwise proportion tests

Data Source :

Type: Primary data
Collection Method: Google Form survey
Sample Size: 349 valid responses

Variables Used :
Independent Variables : Age, Gender, Occupation, Watch frequency, Subtitle preference, Preferred video length

Dependent Variable : Preferred YouTube video category (Music, Education, Gaming, News, Creative, Cooking, etc.)

Methodology :
The analysis is conducted using the following statistical techniques :

1.Chi-Square Test of Independence : To test associations between user factors and video categories

2. Test of Homogeneity of Proportions : To check whether preference proportions are equal across groups

3. Pairwise Proportion Tests : To identify and rank specific group differences

Key Findings : 
1. No single factor consistently explains preferences across all video categories
2. Watch frequency and video length frequently show significant associations
3. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and occupation influence preferences in a category-specific manner
4. User preferences are complex and driven by multiple interacting factors

Tools & Technologies : R Programming, Statistical hypothesis testing, Data visualization

Conclusion :

This project examined the factors influencing YouTube video category preferences using primary survey data and statistical analysis. The study focused on both demographic variables such as age, gender, and occupation, and behavioral variables such as watch frequency, subtitle usage, and preferred video length. Statistical methods including the Chi-square test of independence, the test of homogeneity of proportions, and pairwise proportion tests were used to analyze these relationships.

The results show that user preferences for YouTube video categories are complex and vary across different types of content. No single factor was found to consistently influence preferences across all categories. However, watch frequency and preferred video length were frequently associated with video choice, while demographic factors like age, gender, and occupation showed significant effects only for certain categories. These findings indicate that YouTube viewing behavior is shaped by a combination of factors rather than a single dominant variable.

Although the study provides useful insights, it also has some limitations. The analysis is based on survey data, which may be influenced by response bias and limited sample diversity. In addition, some categories had fewer responses, which may affect the strength of statistical conclusions.

Further analysis can be improved by increasing the sample size and ensuring more balanced representation across different user groups and video categories. Advanced statistical and machine learning methods such as multinomial logistic regression, clustering, or classification models can also be applied to better predict user preferences. Incorporating additional factors such as viewing duration, device usage, or recommendation history may provide deeper insights into user behavior. These improvements can help achieve a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of YouTube content consumption patterns.
