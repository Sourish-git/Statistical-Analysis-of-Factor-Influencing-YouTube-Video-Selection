📊 Analysis of YouTube Video Category Preferences

📌 Project Overview
This project presents an empirical statistical analysis of YouTube video category preferences based on primary survey data. The study investigates how demographic and behavioral factors influence users’ choices across different types of YouTube content.

🎯 Objectives
To examine the association between user characteristics and preferred YouTube video categories

To compare proportions of preferences across different user groups

To identify and rank significant differences using pairwise proportion tests

📂 Data Source

Type: Primary data
Collection Method: Google Form survey
Sample Size: 349 valid responses
Variables Used :
Independent Variables :
Age
Gender
Occupation
Watch frequency
Subtitle preference
Preferred video length

Dependent Variable
Preferred YouTube video category (Music, Education, Gaming, News, Creative, Cooking, etc.)

🧪 Methodology

The analysis is conducted using the following statistical techniques:

Chi-Square Test of Independence
To test associations between user factors and video categories

Test of Homogeneity of Proportions
To check whether preference proportions are equal across groups

Pairwise Proportion Tests
To identify and rank specific group differences

All analyses are performed using R.

📈 Key Findings

No single factor consistently explains preferences across all video categories
Watch frequency and video length frequently show significant associations
Demographic factors such as age, gender, and occupation influence preferences in a category-specific manner
User preferences are complex and driven by multiple interacting factors

🛠 Tools & Technologies

R Programming
Statistical hypothesis testing
Data visualization

📌 Conclusion

The study highlights that YouTube viewing preferences cannot be explained by a single dominant factor. Instead, user behavior reflects a combination of demographic and viewing habits, varying across content categories. These insights can help content creators, researchers, and digital platforms better understand audience behavior.
